# Double slit experiment.

Creating a ./main file: Run the ./makefile
The program is run with the following parameters:
size = Size of the box to simulate.
dt = Size of timestep.
time = Time of simulation.
xc = X coordinate of the center of the wavefunction.
yx = Y coordinate of the center of the wavefunction.
sigmax = Initial width of wave function in the x direction.
sigmay = Initial width of wave function in the y direction.
px = Momentum in the x direction.
py = Momentum in the y direction.
v0 = Size of potential.
slit = How many slits to have, from 0.3.

The textfiles will be saved in plotting/datafiles. Some example plotting files can be found in the plotting folder.
