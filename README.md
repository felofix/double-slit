# Double slit experiment.

Creating a ./main file: Run the ./makefile <br />
The program is run with the following parameters: <br />
size = Size of the box to simulate. <br />
dt = Size of timestep. <br />
time = Time of simulation. <br />
xc = X coordinate of the center of the wavefunction. <br />
yx = Y coordinate of the center of the wavefunction. <br />
sigmax = Initial width of wave function in the x direction. <br />
sigmay = Initial width of wave function in the y direction. <br />
px = Momentum in the x direction. <br />
py = Momentum in the y direction. <br />
v0 = Size of potential. <br />
slit = How many slits to have, from 0.3. <br />

The textfiles will be saved in plotting/datafiles. Some example plotting files can be found in the plotting folder. <br />
